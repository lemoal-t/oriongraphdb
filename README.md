# OrionGraphDB

**A Context Database for AI Agents**

OrionGraphDB is an open-source context compilation engine that provides intelligent, budget-aware retrieval for AI agents. It combines semantic, lexical, and structural search with MMR-based selection to deliver optimal context within token budgets.

---

## 🎯 What is OrionGraphDB?

Think of OrionGraphDB as **"Postgres for AI Context"**:
- Stores and indexes code, documents, and knowledge bases
- Retrieves optimal context for any AI task
- Respects token budgets and diversity constraints
- Explains why each piece of context was selected

### Key Features

- **Multi-Channel Retrieval**: Semantic, lexical (BM25), and structural search
- **MMR Selection**: Maximal Marginal Relevance for diverse, relevant context
- **Token Budget Management**: Never exceed your LLM's context window
- **Citation-Friendly**: Every span has a stable reference and source
- **HTTP API**: Language-agnostic REST interface
- **Fast**: Built in Rust for production performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start the Server

```bash
# Build and run
cargo build --release
./target/release/axongraph-server

# Server runs at http://localhost:8081
```

### Use the Python Client

```python
from axongraph_client import AxonGraphClient

client = AxonGraphClient("http://localhost:8081")

# Compile optimal context
result = client.compile_workingset(
    intent="Find rollback procedures for database migrations",
    budget_tokens=6000,
    workstream="migration",
)

# Use the context
for span in result["workingset"]["spans"]:
    print(f"📄 {span['span_ref']['doc_version_id']}")
    print(f"   {span['text'][:100]}...")
```

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Spans
A **span** is an addressable unit of context:
- Has a unique `span_id`
- Belongs to a `doc_version_id`
- Has a known `token_cost`
- Contains semantic, lexical, and structural metadata

### Working Set
A **working set** is a compiled selection of spans:
- Fits within a token budget
- Maximizes relevance to the intent
- Ensures diversity (via MMR)
- Includes explanations for each selection

### Multi-Channel Retrieval
OrionGraphDB uses three channels:
1. **Semantic**: Vector embeddings for meaning-based search
2. **Lexical**: BM25 for keyword/term matching
3. **Structural**: Project structure, imports, definitions

## 🔧 Architecture

```
OrionGraphDB
├── Context Engine       (Core retrieval logic)
├── Generators           (Semantic, Lexical, Structural)
├── Scoring & Selection  (MMR algorithm)
└── HTTP Server          (REST API)
```

**Technology Stack**:
- **Rust** - Performance and safety
- **Axum** - HTTP framework
- **Tokio** - Async runtime
- **Serde** - Serialization

## 🔌 Integrations

### Python

See [`examples/python-client/`](examples/python-client/) for a full Python client.

```python
from axongraph_client import AxonGraphClient
client = AxonGraphClient()
result = client.compile_workingset(intent="...", budget_tokens=6000)
```

### LangChain

```python
from axongraph_client import AxonGraphClient

def get_context(query: str) -> str:
    client = AxonGraphClient()
    result = client.compile_workingset(intent=query, budget_tokens=4000)
    return "\n\n".join(span["text"] for span in result["workingset"]["spans"])
```

### CrewAI, AutoGPT, DeepAgents

OrionGraphDB works with any agent framework via its HTTP API.
